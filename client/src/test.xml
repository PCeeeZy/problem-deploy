<title>New Balance 992 Takes On Tropical Tones</title>

A known favorite of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the 992 is lauded for its comfort and style — two things that ensure its continued popularity, although it must be noted that Jobs would likely prefer a more toned-down palette.Presented in compelling fashion by German retailer 43einhalb as part of a "One More Thing" editorial, these 992s are undeniably ready for summer. Placing blue and cyan suedes atop a pink mesh and white/blue striped seersucker fabric base, the design offers a comfortingly colorful style without sacrificing any of its signature made-in-the-US quality. New Balance motifs are present on midfoot, tongue and back, with ENCAP midsoles split between sail and white foam. Soft ABZORB gel is placed in the heel, and blue Ndurance rubber outsoles ensure long-lasting traction.The New Balance 992 "Pink/Blue/Cyan" is priced at $220 USD and will release in the coming weeks at 43einhalb and other stockists.Moving from classic to futuristic but keeping things colorful, adidas has added heatmap-inspired graphics to the ZX 2K 4D.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/new-balance-992-pink-blue-cyan-release-date-info" title="New Balance 992 Takes On Tropical Tones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

With vivid colorblocking, a medley of materials and some special details, these low-top Air Jordan 1s are a competent choice for sneaker lovers who want a vibrant look for spring.Built of flat leathers and soft suedes both smooth and perforated, the uppers mix a white toebox, Swoosh and throat with a black mudguard, eyestays and heel. This yin and yang of tones is offset by pink quarter panels with small yellow spray paint-style splotches and yellow collars. Further flair is brought to the table by contrast stitching on the rear half, plus a large yellow ball-and-wings graphic that's embroidered on the heel.There's more to be seen from above too, thanks to pink and yellow detailing on the tongue and throat's branded accents plus alternating colorful Jumpman graphics on the insoles. White rubber midsoles and black outsoles complete the look.The Air Jordan 1 Low SE "Cyber" is available now via the Nike webstore, and retails for $100 USD.For more from Jordan Brand, check out its full Summer 2020 retro lineup — with Air Jordan 4s, Air Jordan 5s, Air Jordan 13s and more.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/air-jordan-1-low-cyber-cw5564-001-release-info" title="Air Jordan 1 Low SE &quot;Cyber&quot; Offers Cheerful Colorblocking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

<title>Jordan Brand Presents Summer 2020 Retro Collection</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p><img width="620" src="https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2020%2F04%2Fjordan-brand-summer-2020-retro-lead-1.jpg?w=800&cbr=1&q=90&fit=max" /></p><div>Jordan Brand has presented its Summer 2020 retro collection. Consisting of fresh takes on beloved Air Jordan silhouettes and re-releases of classics alike, this latest slate of offerings looks to weave together rich Jordan heritage with contemporary street style.New standouts include an Air Jordan 1 "Tie Dye" and an Air Jordan 5 "Top 3." The "Tie Dye" uses familiar black and white leather but differentiates itself by becoming the first AJ1 ever to add tie-dye prints, bold two-tone blue patterns that grace the overlays. It's a women's silhouette, but will be available in an extended size run. Meanwhile, the "Top 3" combines the Air Jordan 5's three most iconic schemes — "Fire Red," "Metallic" and "Grape," — making for a three-headed homage to Air Jordan history.A duo of prominent throwback styles are present as well: the Air Jordan 13 "Flint" and Air Jordan 5 "Fire Red." Back for the first time since 2010, the "Flint" is arguably the most popular AJ13 colorway, and is re-created here with painstaking attention to detail. The "Fire Red" boasts original Nike Air detailing on its heel and a signature shimmering metallic tongue, details that are sure to delight Jordan purists.Air Jordan 4s have a sizable moment in the spotlight too, thanks to a four-shoe "Metallic Pack" that uses glistening "Court Purple," "Team Orange" "University Red" or "Pine Green" embellishments and trim on a crisp white base drawn from 2017's "Pure Money." A women's AJ4 "Rasta" brings the offerings to five with gradient fades on the midfoot mesh and classic cement midsole details.Rounding things off are an Air Jordan 1 "Court Purple," Air Jordan 7 "Hare 2.0" and two versions of the Air Jordan 11 Low: a reversed "Concord" style and a "White Bred." The "Court Purple" and "Hare 2.0" are kicking off the Summer 2020 collection with early April releases — the former nods to Michael Jordan's regal nature on the court, while the latter is an update to a beloved OG AJ7 that was accompanied by a famous commercial starring Bugs Bunny. Lastly, the women's 11 Low "Reversed Concord" nods to an original Air Jordan 11 "Concord" design sketch while the "White Bred" combines a white "Concord" upper with the black and red midsole detailing of the "Bred."The Jordan Brand Summer 2020 Retro collection will begin rolling out with the European release of the Air Jordan 1 "Court Purple" on April 4, and continue over the forthcoming months on Nike SNKRS and the Nike webstore. Note that releases could well be delayed by the continued spread of the novel coronavirus, and check our Drops page for dates as they're announced.Elsewhere, Nike has officially unveiled Kevin Durant's brand-new KD 13.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/air-jordan-13-flint-5-fire-red-top-3-4-metallic-pack-1-high-tie-dye-summer-retro-collection-release-info" title="Jordan Brand Presents Summer 2020 Retro Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

<title>Nike Officially Debuts Kevin Durant's Zoom KD 13</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p><img width="620" src="https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2020%2F04%2Fnike-kd-13-kevin-durant-official-release-date-info-0.jpg?w=800&cbr=1&q=90&fit=max" /></p><div>Nike has officially debuted Kevin Durant's new Zoom KD 13, a design that boasts some of the most potent Zoom Air tech ever placed in a piece of Nike Basketball footwear. Durant's game offers a lethal mix of speed, explosiveness and finesse befitting of his "Slim Reaper" nom de guerre, so the KD 13 aims to provide more responsive court feel than ever before.Zoom Strobel tech — a full-foot Zoom Air unit placed directly under the insole — introduced on the KD 12 returns, but there's one notable difference. Where the KD 12 used double-stacked Zoom in the heel, the KD 13 moves the doubled-up tech to the forefoot, placing a second kidney-shaped cushioning piece under the aforementioned Zoom Strobel. This encourages movement off the ball of the foot and pushes the wearer to quite literally play on their toes, while the doubled-up cushioning units work in tandem for a level of responsiveness that could not be achieved by a single piece of Zoom."The intent behind a Zoom Bag is similar to that of a mechanical spring underfoot,” says Ross Klein, Senior Creative Director for Nike Basketball. “The essence of a spring is to return the amount of energy you put into it. In the KD 13, we're doubling the spring in the form of the double-stacked forefoot Zoom, allowing you more travel in the system and more energy back."From a looks standpoint, the KD 13 offers a sturdy 5/8 cut with a low-slung Swoosh that dips into the midsole. Overlaid wings increase support without adding bulk — which is important to KD, who's known to prefer a light and loose fit. A circular traction pattern on the outsole provides versatile grip, and Durant's new #7 is present on the forefoot as well.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;The KD13 has arrived. " src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/1f440.svg"&gt; Which colorway are you rocking with? @houseofhoopsA post shared by Foot Locker (@footlocker) on Apr 2, 2020 at 7:00am PDTAlthough the KD 13 will debut in a simple "Black/White", plenty of other styles have been announced as well. There's a "Planet of Hoops" with hand-scrawled details and navy/black tones, a "Hype" with a Versace-style gold chain print, a laid-back "Chill" with a rich green base and soft pink/yellow overlays, a "Home Team" with a gridded upper and a marbled outsole pattern that seemingly nods to the Brooklyn Nets' alternate jerseys and a "Bred" reminiscent of Jordan Brand's signature palette.The Nike KD 13 will begin rolling out on April 6 with the international release of the "Black/White" and "Planet of Hoops" colorways, the latter of which is exclusive to Greater China. The "Hype" style releases April 10 in North America, followed by the "Black/White" North American release on April 17. "Chill" releases in North America on April 24, with global releases for "Home Team" and "Bred" hitting on May 1 and June 1, respectively. Retail for each pair is set at $150 USD, and all will be available at the Nike webstore and retailers like Foot Locker.For more from Nike Basketball, check out LeBron James's new LeBron 17 "Command Force," inspired by a classic '90s high-top hoop shoe.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/nike-kd-13-kevin-durant-official-release-date-info" title="Nike Officially Debuts Kevin Durant's Zoom KD 13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

A circular traction pattern on the outsole provides versatile grip, and Durant's new #7 is present on the forefoot as well.</p><blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-eyYO2DLJN/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12"><div style="padding: 16px;"><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div><div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"><div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;"><div><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);"></div><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;"></div><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);"></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);"></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"><div style="width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);"></div><div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);"></div><div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);"></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"><a style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-eyYO2DLJN/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The KD13 has arrived. <img class="emoji" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/1f440.svg" alt="&lt;img draggable=" />" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/1f440.svg"&gt; Which colorway are you rocking with? @houseofhoops</a></p><p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;">A post shared by <a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;" href="https://www.instagram.com/footlocker/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Foot Locker</a> (@footlocker) on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2020-04-02T14:00:14+00:00">Apr 2, 2020 at 7:00am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><p>Although the KD 13 will debut in a simple "Black/White", plenty of other styles have been announced as well.

<title>Dr. Martens 1460: The People's Shoe</title>

So it goes for Dr. Martens’ eight-hole 1460 boot, the silhouette most people would picture if asked to mentally conjure an image of a boot. The just-chunky-enough shape, versatile height and relatively affordable price have guaranteed the shoe over a half-century of global omnipresence. The 1460 is turning 60 years old in 2020 and remains as popular as it was two, three or four decades ago. Capitalizing on this relevance, the brand announced “1460 Remastered” project in January with BAPE, recruiting a dozen headline-worthy designers for collaborative 1460 remixes. These progressive partnerships reveal the 1460’s widespread desirability, but these high-brow efforts are merely a celebratory initiative, rather than a motion to elevate the shoe to some inaccessible, rarefied level. At its core, the 1460 is, and always will be, the people’s shoe.The 1460’s name is derived from its birthdate, April 1, 1960, when the family-run Griggs footwear company exclusively licensed Dr. Klaus Maertens’ air-cushioned sole unit. The revised design was then stitched to a smooth leather upper with the now-iconic yellow welt stitch, with the resulting design remaining mostly unchanged to this day. Originally designed with laborers and postal workers in mind, musicians like Pete Townshend and then the Sex Pistols introduced the 1460 to a new generation of rebellious youth in the 1970s, who adopted the shoe and its low-top 1461 sister silhouette as symbols of civil unrest and individuality. This anti-establishment ethos continued through the ‘80s and ‘90s as post-hair metal grunge, riot grrls and indie rockers sought no-frills comfortable footwear.Marc Jacobs' legendary “Grunge” collection for Perry Ellis Spring/Summer 1993 was the 1460’s first major brush with the fashion industry. The shoe’s presence on the runway upset the established glamour of fashion shows with its stubby, everyman effortlessness. That the shoe is now commonplace amongst influencers like the Hadids and Hailey Bieber is testament to the 1460’s immense wearability.

It’s a crucial ingredient to the continued popularity of corporate brands like Vans, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/the-north-face">The North Face</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/levis">Levi’s</a> among younger consumers, alongside streetwear cornerstones like <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/supreme">Supreme</a>. In fact, Supreme has collaborated with all of those brands, along with Dr. Martens, underscoring the skate brand’s appreciation for heritage labels with household-name status. Though its friendliness to collaborations lends the company savviness, Dr. Martens’ owes a great deal of its success to the unchanging make of the 1460.</p><p>The humble work boot’s design has remained consistent through its existence, whether it was worn by postal employees, rock bands or tween mall-goers. Elegant in its simplicity, the 1460’s unpretentious presentation keeps it free from fickle trends, while its approachable shape encourages versatile styling. Well-suited for jeans, work pants, skirts, slacks and summer shorts, the weighty silhouette is comfortable in all wardrobes.</p><p><img src="https://hypebeast.com/image/2020/03/dr-martens-1460-boot-60th-anniversary-history-impact-style-13.jpg" alt="" /></p><p><img src="https://hypebeast.com/image/2020/03/dr-martens-1460-boot-60th-anniversary-history-impact-style-8.jpg" alt="" /></p><p><img src="https://hypebeast.com/image/2020/03/dr-martens-1460-boot-60th-anniversary-history-impact-style-10.jpg" alt="" /></p><p><img src="https://hypebeast.com/image/2020/03/dr-martens-1460-boot-60th-anniversary-history-impact-style-11.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>Easily the most recognizable iteration of the 1460 is the black smooth leather style. The six-inch tall shoe’s trademarks are its eight eyelets, hardwearing "Airwears" leather uppers and the yellow-stitched slip-resistant sole unit, with a branded black-and-yellow heel pull tab for easy entry. Minimal stitching on the upper reinforces the shaft, ankle and thickly-laced vamp, ensuring trustworthy ruggedness.</p><p>Of course, the boot is more than the sum of its parts. The shape is just as, if not more, important: the gently-tapered shaft extends outward at the heel and forefoot, curving around the toes, neither snub nor blunt. Meanwhile the sole sports a chunky heel, sliced slimmer underfoot for enhanced grip. Wear tests refined these elements -- the 1460 never catered to fashion’s whims. Effortlessness begets coolness, and therein lies part of boot’s counterculture allure.</p><p>Its solid upper also serves as a palette for expansive illustrations, be it hand-drawn doodles, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/1/dr-martens-cbgb-1460-boot-collaboration-release-info">thematic prints</a> or <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/1/dr-martens-sex-pistols-collaboration-footwear-release-info">artistic graphics</a>. The appeal in <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/schott-nyc-dr-martens-1460-1490-boot-release">tweaking </a>the 1460 comes from the inherent pleasure in <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/3/virgil-abloh-figures-of-speech-ica-boston-info">re-contextualizing familiar shapes</a> by placing them in unfamiliar situations or adding unusual accoutrement. Anchored by its inherent wearability, the 1460 takes well to remixes both <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/dr-martens-haven-1460-jungle-boot-collab-release-info">style-conscious</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/6/dr-martens-joy-division-new-order-peter-saville-boots">austere</a>.</p><p><img src="https://hypebeast.com/image/2020/03/dr-martens-1460-boot-60th-anniversary-history-impact-style-9.jpg" alt="" /></p><p><img src="https://hypebeast.com/image/2020/02/dr-martens-1460-tartan-gradient-boots-01.jpg" alt="" /></p><p><img src="https://hypebeast.com/image/2020/03/dr-martens-1460-boot-60th-anniversary-history-impact-style-7.jpg" alt="" /></p><p>Unwavering popularity has guaranteed the 1460’s continued appeal, a legacy cemented when the boot took home <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/footwear-news-achievement-awards-2019-winners-honorees-list">Footwear News' “Shoe of the Year” award in 2019</a>. The silhouette is perhaps more crucial than any other shoe to Dr. Martens’ future prospects, particularly as the brand’s owner, Permira, now <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/dr-martens-permira-for-sale-valuation">seeks a boosted valuation</a> for the heritage brand (Supreme investor <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2017/10/supreme-sale-valuation-billion-dollars-carlyle-group">Carlyle Group</a> is reportedly interested). Whether Dr. Martens changes hands or not, however, the 1460’s future is secure.</p><p>Taste-making designs shape the course of history: consider the influence of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/vitsoe">Vitsœ</a>’s modular shelving and James Dyson’s bagless vacuum. These aren’t merely indicators of good taste, but examples of creations that influence accessibility for all of humankind. Dr. Martens’ 1460 boot shares that inherent relevance; the shoe proof-positive that good design lives forever.</p><p>The “1460 Remastered” project will deliver nine more covetable collaborations throughout 2020, following <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/3/dr-martens-babylon-beams-1460-remasted-release-details">BEAMS </a>and<a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/2/raf-simons-dr-martens-1460-spring-summer-2020-remastered"> Raf Simons</a>’ special models. Despite the timely alterations and special revisions, however, the crux of the celebration is the classic 1460 boot, unwavering in shape and specification for six decades.</p><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/dr-martens-1460-boot-shoe-60th-anniversary" title="Dr. Martens 1460: The People's Shoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p><p> <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/1015938/Hypebeast_RSS_300x250_Rectangle&sz=300x250&c=99615" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/1015938/Hypebeast_RSS_300x250_Rectangle&sz=300x250&c=99615" /> </a></p>

This time, the duo is reinvigorating Nike's high-performance, avant-garde running shoe with the Stüssy x Nike Air Zoom Spiridon Caged 2. In addition to the new "Fossil" and "Pure" colorways of the sneaker, the collection also carries co-branded apparel, including a long-sleeved T-shirt, sweats, knit top, crew fleece and a tote bag with Sean Stussy‘s signature hand-scrawled graphic. The accessories showcase Nike's classic athlesiure garments with nods to Stüssy's skate and surf origins. StockX has struck gold, carrying the shoe at an average sale price of $337 USD while trading at 68.8% over MSRP.The “Fossil” colorway puts an otherworldly spin on the Spiridon silhouette, diverging from its sport origins with an upper crafted of rough tan canvas panels. Dressed in a monochromatic design for the majority of the shoe, the Swooshes remain sleek and clean in a full black paint job. The "Pure/Platinum" edition offers a fine silver mesh upper matched with glossy silver overlays. Patterned black accents finish off the heel, tongue and midfoot Swooshes for a dark contrast. Both iterations feature Stüssy badges on the tongues and heels as well as small brand touches upon the outsoles with a black cage surrounding the heel's air bubble.Head over to StockX now to grab the Stüssy x Nike Air Zoom Spiridon Caged 2 "Fossil" and "Pure" before they're gone.

SUNNEI Plays With Exotic Prints & Colors For DREAMY Shoe Collection

Much like its SS20 campaign which spotlighted a community, the shoes capture the essence of inclusivity by being offered as a unisex collection, modelled on a heterogeneous selection of muses from SUNNEI's creative community.For SUNNEI, the motive was to be "effortlessly cool," and it has achieved this with its new range of DREAMY Sabot mules. These appear in a wide variety of colorways and materials, from the tennis-ready green-and-white leather iteration python-embossed leather pair, and the summer-ready denim pair.Elsewhere, we see a bevy of classic DREAMY shoes in "Acid Green" neoprene, white leather, red crocodile-embossed leather and more. All of the classic pairs sport the signature thick, bumper-like sole unit alongside a contrasting outsole. The same design features can be found on the new DREAMY high-tops, which give the shoe a boot aesthetic in shades ranging from "Mango" to python-embossed leather.The entire SUNNEI DREAMY shoe collection for SS20 can be seen in the gallery above, and purchased online via SUNNEI's website. Pairs range from €380 EUR to €430 EUR (approx. $414 USD -- $468 USD).For more summer-ready shoes, check out Acne Studios' geometric leather sandals.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/sunnei-dreamy-shoe-collection-spring-summer-2020-mules-sneakers-high-tops-release-info" title="SUNNEI Plays With Exotic Prints &amp; Colors For DREAMY Shoe Collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

A visible 11 of diamonds print points to the theme — a number that has been a repetitive figure in Kyrie Irving's life. The colorful motif can be found stretched from the throat to the collar lining, plus on branding hits like the panel swooshes and Irving tongue logo. Additional details include an all-seeing eye emblem on the strap, a hamsa heel piece, a white midsole with a gradient stripe and tonal laces for a stunning finish.Take a look at the imagery below. The Nike Kyrie 6 is available now on Nike JP for ¥17,050 JPY (approximately $160 USD). According to Foot Locker's release calendar, it'll hit Stateside April 24.Elsewhere in footwear, take a look at the extraterrestrial Nike Air Max 95 "Alien" here.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/nike-kyrie-6-midnight-navy-psychic-blue-laser-crimson-release-info-bq4631-402" title="The Nike Kyrie 6 Takes on a Playing Cards Motif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

The silhouette was originally worn in the label's SS20 runway show, embracing a breezy half-open design. This release follows a '90s-inspired "Monster in My Pocket" collection from back in February.The sandals are dominated by sleek black leather, complemented by a set of functional details for a semi-sporty look. On top of its geometric build, it comes with tonal buckles at the heel, which allows the wearer to easily slide into the sandals — the fit can also be adjusted at the buckles with its thin leather straps. At the forefoot are three wide panels: one at the tongue and two others that stack diagonally on top of each other. The frontmost part of the silhouette sees a tiny open-toe construction, emphasized by its flattened edge. All of these details sit atop a wedged foam midsole, accompanied by heavy treading for optimal traction and support.Acne Studio's Distressed Geometric Leather Sandals are currently available at MATCHESFASHION's website for $442 USD.In case you missed it, check out the label's A.I.-inspired FW20 show from back in January.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/acne-studios-square-toe-distressed-sole-leather-sandals-release" title="Acne Studio Drops Distressed Geometric Leather Sandals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

Chris Joslin Signs and Jumps Over His Etnies Kicks at The Berrics

Apart from dropping his signature on the packaging of his signature sneakers, Joslin also took a spin around The Berrics' park, throwing hammers down the park's stair set and many ledges. For select tricks, he also puts his shoeboxes to use, turning them into "extra stairs" or stacking them on top of a ledge to increase the difficulty of his tricks.&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;@chrisjoslin_ Signed, Sealed, and Delivered is live!! LINK IN BIO We have Chris Joslin's new Etnies shoe, the Joslin 2, in stock in The @BerricsCanteen! The man even stopped by the park to skate over and sign some of the shoeboxes—if you're lucky you may even find a pair of socks included with your order! Hit the link in our bio to watch the video and get your pair of Joslin 2 with an autographed box from Chris Joslin! #skateboardingisfun #berricsA post shared by The Berrics (@berrics) on Apr 1, 2020 at 8:39am PDTJoslin wasn't just signing his shoeboxes for posterity either: every pair with a signed box is for sale on The Berrics' Canteen. Although the Joslin 2 quickly sold out, there is another option: select sizes of the Etnies Marana x Michelin are still in stock, and priced at $75 USD. Socks will also be included in some orders at random.Head over to The Berrics' Canteen to grab a pair now, and if you're looking for more skateboarding content, check out Russell Houghten’s Urban Isolation, an eerie 3-minute clip that shows a lone skater pushing through an abandoned downtown Los Angeles.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/chris-joslin-signed-etnies-the-berrics-canteen-release-date-info" title="Chris Joslin Signs and Jumps Over His Etnies Kicks at The Berrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

If you peer into the insole, however, you'll see a hidden surprise: the same alien head from the tongue, surrounded by repeating Swoosh graphics.The Nike Air Max 95 "Alien" is available at retailers like Oneness, and is priced at $170 USD.For more from Nike, check out Kyrie Irving's Nike Kyrie 6 "Shutter Shades," a strange-but-humorous homage to the Venetian blinders Kanye West popularized in the mid-'00s.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/nike-air-max-95-alien-cw5451-100-release-date-info" title="Nike Air Max 95 &quot;Alien&quot; Gets Extraterrestrial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

Using bold gradient fades, the "Move" pack offers "PUMA Black/Etherial Blue" and "Limestone/Gray Violet" colorways, both made of premium materials.Each pair puts forth a mesh upper, equipped with wavy suede overlays and a signature PUMA Formstripe. RS-X series badges are present on the tongue, and midsoles offer a chunky look to compliment the upper's stacked style. Although the construction may be identical on both pairs, the hues are vastly divergent."PUMA Black/Ethereal Blue" starts with a bright blue shade on the toebox before giving way to stark black on the forefoot and steel gray plus soft khaki on the heel and midsole, respectively. Meanwhile, "Limestone/Gray Violet" uses a color scheme akin to RHUDE's earth-toned PUMA collaborations, offering a full medium gray forefoot and light gray midfoot. Black detailing is present around the throat and heel, with the only gradient arriving on the midsole — which fades from gray to khaki.Both RS-X³ Move colorways are priced at $110 USD, and will release on the PUMA webstore and at retailers like BILLY's Tokyo come April 4.If you prefer your kicks more monochromatic and muted, take a look at New Balance's understated ML850 "Mono" pack.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/puma-rs-x3-move-pack-372429-01-02-release-date-info" title="PUMA RS-X³ Move Pack Uses Vivid Gradient Fades" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

ally the Kyrie 6. The Kyrie 6 has already explored Kyrie's fascination with ancient Egyptian culture via "Khepri" and "Golden Mummy" styles created by Concepts and appeared in a "Bruce Lee" iteration, but now it's nodding to an infamous '00s fashion trend with a "Shutter Shades" makeup.Also known as Venetian blinders, these horizontally slatted sunglasses were popularized by one Kanye West in 2007, and are now serving as the inspiration for Kyrie's latest signature style. Equipped with a stark black upper, the Kyrie 6 "Shutter Shades" offers a duo of signature details: a textured hamsa heel piece that glows in the dark, and an iridescent Swoosh rimmed with blue trim.Other details include pops of green and yellow placed around the lacing system and on the tongue branding, plus more hamsa graphics on the midfoot strap. Outsoles bring one final all-seeing eye accent, and combine a modified herrigbone traction pattern with Air Zoom Turbo forefoot cushioning for a responsive feel.Kyrie and his Brooklyn Nets may be off the court for an indefinite period of time due to the novel coronavirus, but the Nike Kyrie 6 "Shutter Shades" is available on the Nike webstore now for $130 USD.Elsewhere in the world of hoop shoes, LeBron James's Nike LeBron 17 has appeared in a bold new style that salutes the classic Command Force.</div><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/nike-kyrie-6-shutter-shades-bq4630-004-release-info" title="Nike Kyrie 6 &quot;Shutter Shades&quot; Nods to an Infamous '00s Fashion Trend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p>

Outsoles bring one final all-seeing eye accent, and combine a modified herrigbone traction pattern with Air Zoom Turbo forefoot cushioning for a responsive feel.</p><p>Kyrie and his <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a> may be off the court for an indefinite period of time due to the novel <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/coronavirus">coronavirus</a>, but the Nike Kyrie 6 "Shutter Shades" is available on the <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/kyrie-6-chinese-new-year-basketball-shoe-TW3wsC/BQ4630-004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike webstore</a> now for $130 USD.</p><p>Elsewhere in the world of hoop shoes, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>'s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-lebron-17">Nike LeBron 17</a> has appeared in a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/nike-lebron-17-command-force-bq3177-100-release-info">bold new style that salutes the classic Command Force</a>.</p><p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/nike-kyrie-6-shutter-shades-bq4630-004-release-info" title="Nike Kyrie 6 &quot;Shutter Shades&quot; Nods to an Infamous '00s Fashion Trend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view full gallery at HYPEBEAST</a></p><p> <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/1015938/Hypebeast_RSS_300x250_Rectangle&sz=300x250&c=26299" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/1015938/Hypebeast_RSS_300x250_Rectangle&sz=300x250&c=26299" /> </a></p>
